## Proposed Level of Achievement: 
Apollo 11


## Motivation
With the rise in popularity of r/WallStreetBets and the whole saga surrounding GME stocks, many people are getting into the stock market. As a new investor entering the stock market and executing trades initially, it may be daunting a experience and we may be unsure of what strategies to use to make profitable trades. Moreover, it is hard to keep track of what is important with so much news in the market and so many macroeconomic trends that will impact the stock market. As such,our team would create a simulation of the stock market trading web app where we can buy and sell stocks, without using real money. This web app will simulate the live stock market and allow users to execute trades. Moreover, this platform will allow users to interact with their friends on the platform to allow for communication and peer learning.



## Vision
We will launch a one-stop web app that allows our users to experience building their own portfolios and experience investing. Users will be able to keep track of all the trades that they have made and hence evaluate their strategies and positions taken overtime. Moreover, users can share their portfolios with others and interact so as to learn and understand each other’s perspective that will allow them to form more informed decisions when they are investing. Ultimately, we wish to give them a social platform to experience investing and share their progress and updates with their friends as they undergo their investing journey on the platform.

## User Stories
- As a new investor, I would want to be able to buy and sell my stock holdings whenever I see fit during trading hours
- As a new investor, I would want to be able to see the transactions of all my trades and keep track of the prices of those transactions as well the amount of free cash  I have on hand
- As a new investor, I would want to be able to search for a stock I’m interested in and get all the important data regarding it. I would like a watchlist where I can add these stocks into so I can monitor them easily
- As a new investor practicing on the app, I would like to interact with my friends also using the app so that we can compare portfolios and discuss about the strategies and trades we have made
- As an admin, I would like to be able to see the brief overview of all the users of my app. However, their login credentials will be kept private only to the users.


## Scope of Project and Features:
This React Web application will be a one-stop application for our users to practice their execution of trades based off what they have in mind, without the need to use any of their own money. 


- Personal account that stores all of the user data (transactions, cash, watchlist etc)
- Buy and Sell Stocks at Live Market Trading Prices
- Receive News Updates related to their stocks or that are important market wide
- View past transactions and all its details 
- A watchlist to track stocks and their details that we are actively monitoring 
- A forum for users to interact and share their investing portfolios and strategies.

## How are we different from other platforms:
- Our user interface and functionalities are more simplified compared to professional trading apps that may seem overly complex to the new investor. This app makes it simple and allows users to focus on executing their trading strategies
- Users get to interact with their friends on the platform to allow for peer learning

## Development Plan:
 - Week 3 of May: Finalised LiftOff Submission. Attended workshops and watched online tutorials on building of web applications using React and using of Git

- Week 4 of May: Picking up relevant technologies — Reactjs, JavaScript, Firebase, CSS. Created a Mockup of what our web application should look like on Figma. Implemented the basics of our web application, including the Login functionality, the Buying and Selling functionalities and keeping track of the users’ transactions.  
- Week 1 of June: Submission of Milestone 1. Polishing up the UI. Addition of email/password login. Implementation of the user’s wallet to keep track of the user’s wealth. Adding a transaction page (which replaces the portfolio page). Addition of a new portfolio page. Adding a watchlist to the Home page. 

- Week 2 of June: Start adding the forum functionalities. Polishing up the UI.

- Week 3 of June: Addition of a News Page. 

- Week 4 of June: Finish the implementation of all basic functionalities. Testing of our web application. 

- Week 1 of July: Improve the News page to provide curated news. Addition of an explore page for users to search up different companies stock prices history. Discuss on peer evaluation

- Week 2 of July: Improve the web application with regards to peer evaluation.

- Week 3 of July: Testing and debugging

- Week 4 of July: Touchup and Submission of Milestone 3

## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
